# Major Project Reflection

## What adivce would you give yourself when working on a similar project in the future?

- Don't spend too much time on trying to achieve something that is not achievable within the given time span.
- Distribute your time effectively. If you have been working on a single aspect of your game for weeks, it's time to move on. This is what I learned during the first/second week of making the game and I was trying to figure out multiplayer functionality.
- Be consistent.

## Did you complete everything on your needs-to-have list?

- Yes, I did.
- Although, I would have liked to have added more items other than the 3 ammos and 3 guns.

## What was the hardest part of the project?

- In terms of the code, I think the hardest part was adding enemies with realistic movement and fixing and finding all the little bugs that came with it.
- Doing so made me go into a rabbit hole of autonomous agent pathfinding and steering. I finally ended up using a custom steering library meant to be used with three.js.
- The last bug I faced with regards to planck.js was very demotivating and devastating since it seemed almost unfixable and it meant that all the effort I poured into the game would be a waste. However, I was eventually able to figure it out.
- It was also hard to not procrastinate configuring certain parts of the project.

## Any problems that you coulnd't solve?

- On the most part, I am happy with how the game turned out as there are barely any problems that I couldn't figure out.
- That said, sometimes the enemies tend to hit obstacles and very rarely, they get stuck next to obstacles as well. It was a tradeoff that I had to make, choosing between having natural, smooth steering as opposed to robotic, abrupt steering that basically "bounces" away when approaching obstacles.
- Although my original intention was to make this game multiplayer, I decided very early on that trying to achieve it would be beyond my capabilities and so I just replaced that aspect with realistic enemies.
