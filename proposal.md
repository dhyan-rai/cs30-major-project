# Project description

My project is going to be a basic 3D first person shooter based on games like Valorant and CSGO. Users can move around using WASD keys and can interact with the environment. They can shoot at targets or enemies to eliminate them. In multiplayer mode, players can shoot at each other and decrease their health.

## Needs To Have List

- basic character movement
- ability to shoot bullets
- fairly well designed 3d models
- ability to zoom in to aim
- something to shoot at (enemies or targets)
- appropriate lighting and sound effects             

## Nice to Have List

- detailed character movement
- multiplayer functionality
- different guns to shoot with
- a reload animation
- make it not lag a lot
- a scope graphic to aim
- pick and drop items
