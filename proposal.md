# Project description

My project is a 2D Battle Royale style game with core gameplay and mechanics being based on games like Fortnite or PUBG. It is a multiplayer game where players spawn at different locations on a huge map and have to gather resources from their surroundings (chests and crates) to both survive and eliminate opponents. Players also have to look out for the storm/zone that slowly approaches the middle of the map, pushing players to the mdidle. The last one standing wins.

## Needs To Have List

- more than 5 items in the game
- crates/loot chests placed at random locations in the map
- bullet-player collisions
- a zone/storm that closes in and damages players
- an inventory to hold items
- smooth bullet physics
- a "you died" screen and a "you win" screen
- well designed map
- multiplayer functionality
- a timer that shows how long you have left

## Nice to Have List

- a minimap displaying your location on the map
- a cool way to drop/spawn on the map (like the battlebus in Fortnite)
- around 10 items (including utilities and weapons)
- a spectator mode once you die
- small buildings that you can enter
- allowing players to have custom usernames
- a chat showing who eliminated who
- improved inventory management
- a clean looking GUI
